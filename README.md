## Description & Usage
A simple tool that shortens Amazon URLs and puts them in your clipboard to be pasted conveniently.

<p>Example Execution</p>
</div>

Amazon URLs, at times, have the tendency to be longer than Wiz Khalifa's supposed "money" as he so intricately once claimed. Take a look at the below example.

<div align="center">
"My money long." —Wiz Khalifa
</div>
<br>

This a certified mess of an Amazon URL, which could be fed into AMZNNinja:

```
https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A12x25-PWM-Premium-Quality-Quiet/dp/B07C5VG64V/ref=sxin_9_ac_d_rm?ac_md=0-0-bm9jdHVhIDEyMG1tIGZhbg%3D%3D-ac_d_rm&crid=3VCQRA626B19Q&cv_ct_cx=noctua+120mm+fan&dchild=1&keywords=noctua+120mmfan&pd_rd_i=B07C5VG64V&pd_rd_r=90e2bddc-1612-4662-a92d-4d4f2c6f23ac&pd_rd_w=39Imv&pd_rd_wg=achez&pf_rd_p=1493ce18-a74b-4311-9662-82d8e55e9a65&pf_rd_r=Q4FWD3GCHBTQ32XDD1JS&psc=1&qid=1620065761&sprefix=noctua%2Caps%2C458&sr=1-1-12d4272d-8adb-4121-8624-135149aa9081
```

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SHUR1K-N/AMZNNinja-Amazon-URL-Shortener/master/Images/Complete URL.png">
<p>Wiz Khalifa URL</p>
</div>

And AMZNNinja would output this cleaner, shorter, and—obviously—functional version of the URL:

`https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C5VG64V`

<div align="center">

<p>AMZNNinja URL</p>
</div>

Beautiful, isn't it?

This project was created in Python, for personal use. Sending friends and family Amazon URLs was an eyesore, so this was conceived as soon as I noticed a consistent pattern of redundancy within Amazon URLs.
